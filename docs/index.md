# Vuex Superstore

## Overview

Vuex Superstore is a package of **helpers** and **plugins** that bring consistency and simplicity to data access in Vuex-based projects, as well as providing some additional functionality.

Its key features are:

- simplified store facade via `get()` and `set()`
- consistent property referencing using `'path/to/value'`
- transparent resolution of `getters`, `mutations` and `actions`

Additional functionality includes:

- Component helpers like `sync()` and `syncSome()` to minimise component wiring
- Store helpers like `makeMutations()` to minimise store boilerplate
- Store plugins like `initial` and `persist` add useful lifecycle functionality

See all functionality demoed in the project below:
