# Vuex Pathify

> ### Path access to Vuex stores

## Overview

Vuex Pathify is 

a package of **helpers** and **plugins** that provides consistency, simplicity and additional functionality to Vuex projects.

Its key features are:           

- simplified store facade via `get()` and `set()`
- consistent property referencing via `'path/to/value'`
- transparent resolution of `getters`, `mutations` and `actions`

Additional functionality includes:

- Component helpers like `sync()` and `syncSome()` to minimise component wiring
- Store helpers like `makeMutations()` to minimise store boilerplate
