# Vuex Pathify

## Overview

Pathify provides a unified and intuitive path interface to Vuex stores.

The plugin aims to solve several everyday Vuex issues:

- inconsistent interface for state, getters, mutations and actions
- boundary issues with components required to know store implementation
- store bloat due to "pass-through" getters, mutations and actions
- component bloat due to two-way data binding setup
- general Vuex-related code verbosity

In practical terms, Pathify results in zero store boilerplate, one-liner wiring and overall cleaner code.
