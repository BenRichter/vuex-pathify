##Â Overview

Pathify makes working with Vuex **easy**, with a **unified, state-based, path syntax**:

![pathify-path](docs/assets/img/readme/pathify-path.png)

Pathify's core helpers let you easily **read, write** or **sync** any store **property** or **sub-property**:

![pathify-diagram](docs/assets/img/readme/pathify-diagram.png)

In conjunction with store helpers, Pathify results in zero store boilerplate, one-liner wiring, less cognitive overhead, and radically cleaner code.


## Pathify API

Let's look a little more closely at the code needed to do this.

Our example store has **module**, **property** and **sub-property** nodes:

![vuex-store](docs/assets/img/readme/vuex-store.png)

The store is made **writeable** using Pathify's one-liner [store helpers]:

![pathify-mutations](docs/assets/img/readme/pathify-mutations.png)

Pathify's [store accessors] and handle global **I/O** whilst [component helpers] handle **wiring**:

![pathify-code](docs/assets/img/readme/pathify-code.png)

Using the now familiar [path syntax] sub-properties are accessed using the `@` symbol, whilst multiple properties can be wired using object, array, or even wildcard `*` syntax wiring groups of properties automatically.


## Comparing to Vuex

The start of most Vuex projects require extensive manual, labourious, store setup:

![vuex-mutations](docs/assets/img/readme/vuex-mutations.png)
 
Getting and setting values requires juggling accessors, syntax and naming:

![vuex-code](docs/assets/img/readme/vuex-code.png)

Component wiring can require up to 4 different helpers, name juggling, plus additional template binding:

Pathify's demo [compares](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/davestewart/vuex-pathify/tree/master/demo?initialpath=code) what could be considered both typical and large components across a variety of Pathify and Vuex setups, and finds Pathify setups coming in between 2 and 15 times less code than vanilla Vuex.
